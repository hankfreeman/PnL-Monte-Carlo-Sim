# 🧮 Profit and Loss Monte Carlo Simulator

This app uses historical company data from the PnL like salary expense, overhead and commission income.
It allows the user to select the best fit regression for each of these line items.
The resulting profit equation (system of equations) can be used to generate monte carlo simulations to speculate how the company might become more profitable by an aggressive hiring campaign.
